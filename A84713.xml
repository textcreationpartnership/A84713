            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>To any honest hearted Reader.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Onest hearted Reader, although the first intention was to present a briefe view, in halfe a sheete of paper to the High and Honourable Court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, of the State of the Countrey; (especially in these Staffordian parts, upon request,) touching such particulars, as are herein mentioned; yet having then onely drawne an over briefe and compendious comprehension of these things; <hi>Dum brevis esse laboravi, obscunus sum factus,</hi> and was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken by some that perused the same upon the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viaries first ascention. Thereupon I have enlarged, the same for further explication, condescending to the apprehension of the weakest and meanest Reader (presuming upon the patience of the Noble Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots, to whom it is chiefely intended,) that so all sorts might have the perusall hereof for further satisfaction of those doubts and objections, that very many make against the Presbyterian Government, as not to bee introduced into the Church of <hi>England,</hi> especially not standing with a Monarchicall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
<pb facs="tcp:125514:3"/> Here, therefore is the Presbyterian way sitted to the State of the <hi>English</hi> Church, as now it stands, (in a way as neere as may bee, it being not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary in every circumstance to cohere with any other Church though never so sound) by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission and setling whereof, might arise a most hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py sweet harmony, betweene our selves and other reformed Churches, especially the Church of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> betwixt whom it is most to bee wished there may bee a concordance, being within the same Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions. Great presumption were it in any one man, especially in so weake and meane a man, as my selfe, to prescribe any thing in this kind; I have one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cast in my <hi>Symbolum,</hi> yet not rashly neither, for after I had set downe such thoughts, as God was pleased to suggest unto mee at vacant houres, I first exposed the Notes to the peruseall of sundry intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Readers, both of the Layty and Clergy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it concerneth both, and having so generall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, and so many encouragements by words and letters. I have beene bold to expose them to publike view, and that under this title, because so many assent herein. I humbly wish, this generall answere may bee given to any, that may except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, that as every one had liberty to bring something towards the building of the materiall Temple, and they that brought but Goats haire were accepted: So is it not a time now for every one to doe something to helpe forward the great worke in hand; some one way, some another? one that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour, may put the more able and better gifted in mind of what may bee usefull. Time was, when
<pb facs="tcp:125514:3"/> the very keeking of the Geese was of singular use. That God that tieth not himselfe to any meanes or instruments, but workes sometimes without, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst, or contrary to meanes: oftentimes by unlike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meanes and instruments, that so the glory may bee his owne, bringing mighty things to passe, not by might, not by power, but by his Spirit, that is, by the way and meanes which his Spirit revealeth and appointeth, before which, great Mountaines shall become a plaine; this God (I say) give his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to these endeavours, so farre as they are agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his owne will, revealed in his owne word, and so to him alone shall bee ascribed all the praise.</p>

            <head>The generall Heads, briefely touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole, being as a tast to such, as have leasure to read no more, the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course enlarging it selfe beyond the first intentions.</head>
            <list>
               <item>1. <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Remonstrance of the State of the Countrey in respect of Preaching, where it is shewed, most places have either no Preachers, or such as are negligent, or such as are scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous. Hereupon aboundeth monstrous dissolutenesse of living. <hi>Pag.</hi> 1.</item>
               <item>2. The causes and occasions of such scarcity of sound Preaching, are conceived to bee five. <hi>Pag.</hi> 2.</item>
               <item>3. The remedy propounded with all humility to consideration, consists in three words. First, That such places as have suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Preaching, and maintenance so continue. Secondly, That such as want maintenance, may have a competency from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for the service they doe them; proved by the law and the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Gospell. Yet to bee content with poverty where the people can afford no better. Three reasons against Impropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and that they are the fittest maintenance. Yet no Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priator to bee looser by parting with them to the Church againe. Thirdly, That unfitting Preachers bee displaced, and have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance. And sufficient ones set in their stead, as they can bee procured. Till which time, places that want, are to bee supplied by weeekely exercises. The manner of the same, with an Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy for the tender. <hi>Pag.</hi> 3.</item>
               <item>4. The setling of this course in a way tending to introduce the Primitive Government. The present Parliament to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point
<pb facs="tcp:125514:4"/> Preachers for the said weekely exercise in each hundred, which should engage themselves to uphold it their time. And to have power to renew their owne number upon the death of any, or any other occasion, and to increase their number as faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Labourers increase. It hath beene Gods manner to joyne Ministers together for their mutuall helpe. These must be such, as deserve well A notable discovery how to find such. <hi>Pag.</hi> 12.</item>
               <item>5. For an happy progresse in reformation, the Parliament to appoint Assistants to the Ministers, called Lay-elders. Some limited power to bee committed to these Pastours and Elders consisting in foure things, First, To oversee, that every place within their hundred, have sufficient preaching as soone as can bee procured, and weekely exercises in the meane while. The Congregation, are to chuse their Preacher, or consent freely if it may bee. If they want judgement, then to have assistance. No buying, nor seeking living for the prefersments sake. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to bee refused or removed. Secondly, To oversee, that every place have sufficient maintenance, according to the order the present Parliament shall appoint or prescribe in their owne wisedome. Thirdly, That they oversee the execution of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. The office of Ministers in this respect. The occasion hereof from the evils of our Spirituall Courts. The great ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of Discipline. Power of the keyes what? why so called. Reasons five against Pastours, having temporall jurisdiction. Objections touching this answered. Divinity Lectures, moneth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in each hundred by the Doctours (or Teachers,) seated in great benefices, able to maintaine both a Pastour, and a Teacher. No Diocesan-Lord-Bishops. The beginning of the <hi>Romane</hi> Primacy. Fourthly, That the Pastours and Elders oversee such Deacons in such a way for the Poore as the Parliament shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point. <hi>Pag.</hi> 15.</item>
               <item>6. The modest confirmation of this course, severall wayes: First, From the nature of Church Government. Secondly, From 10. Scriptures opened and examined. Herein is shewed what <hi>Prophecy</hi> is, <hi>Teaching,</hi> and <hi>Exhorting,</hi> belong thereto. Also what <hi>Ministry</hi> is, Its offices are: First, To distribute. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, To governe. Thirdly, To shew mercy. Some offices tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
<pb facs="tcp:125514:5"/> as Apostles, some perpetuall as Teachers. Maintenance due to Church-officers. Ever looke to <hi>CHRISTS</hi> institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thirdly, From reasons taken. First, From the objects of Church Government. Secondly, From the parts and faculties, or powers of man. Thirdly, From the State of the Church. The fourth Testimony, is from Authours generally received as Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox, touching Past<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>urs, Teachers, Discipline, Deacons, the power of Church-meetings, elections, and deciding controversies, and touching order. All which, shew that the variation from this government, here pointed out in these things, did grow rather by custome of the Church then by any ordination of <hi>CHRIST</hi> and his Apostles. A fift confirmation is from the remove all of 10. objections. The Civill Government of the Church briefely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in the last answere. 28.</item>
               <item>Lastly, the Conclusion of the whole, wherein we are desired not to cleave to those that weave the web of their owne inventions, but <hi>Vsque ad necem,</hi> to stick fast to <hi>CHRISTS</hi> owne insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, the want whereof, is a maine cause, why the word of God in the Ministry thereof, taketh so little effect in these corrupted times. The end of this worke is, that wee may not onely bee deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from Tyranny, but also preserved from confusion. To which end, the Almighty ever guard, and guide all your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours. <hi>Pag.</hi> 57.</item>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:125514:7"/> the people for their service. This maintenance that God bestowed on the Priests for their serving of him, was a bountifull maintenance, <hi>Numb.</hi> 18 19. To the end, hee might encourage them in his service, as it is said in 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 31. 4. And there was not any of them that did so much as shut the doores of Gods sanctuary, or kindle a fire on his Altar for nought; <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 10. And to the Sonnes of <hi>Levi,</hi> the Lord gave all the tenth in <hi>Israel</hi> for an inheritance for their service which they served; for as the <hi>Levits</hi> were joyned to the Priests in service, so in provision for mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, <hi>Numb.</hi> 18. 21.

               <p>Now the equity of these things remaine perpetually, as <note place="margin">Equity in the Gospell.</note> the Apostle observeth, saying: <hi>Doe yee not know that they that minister about holy things, eate of the things of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and they which wait at the Altar, are partakers with the Altar? Even so hath the Lord ordained, that they which preach the Gospell, should live on the Gospell;</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 13. 14. And as the ministry now is more excellent then the ministry of the law. So should the Reward for the more excellent ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice not bee inferiour, to that which God gave for the lesse excellent worke and service. By <hi>Numb.</hi> 18. 31. what they had in the law, appeareth to bee their due for the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice they performed for the people: So the Apostle, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the honour, due to the Ministers of CHRIST, saith, <hi>The Labourer is worthy of his reward,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. 18.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:125514:7"/> And CHRIST himselfe tels his Disciples, <hi>The Labourer is worthy of his reward, Luke</hi> 10. 7. But this matter wee are loath to presse, least wee should seeme to preach our selves, though indeed this is a part of Scripture, which wee must not neglect when occasion requireth us to speake of it.</p>
               <p>But what if the Revenues of the place bee so small, and <note place="margin">Yet to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, when the place can afford no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> the poverty of the people such, that the Pastour cannot have a competency, what must bee done then? Surely that Minister whom God hath set over such a people must bee content with his portion, taking in good part what suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth for necessity, seeing hee is by Gods all-ordering pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence seated amongst a people that are not able better to provide for him. Remembring those words of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 9. <hi>I know thine affliction and thy poverty but thou art rich.</hi> The Angell of that Church of <hi>Smyrna</hi> was a right excellent Shepheard, and tooke great paines in feeding and guiding the flock of CHRIST, yet his reward in this World was but smale, hee lived in poverty. But what, did not the flock care for him? yea doubtlesse, if they had beene rich, hee should not have beene poore. Hee did not repine at it. Hee was not an hireling that dealt for filthy lucre, but dealt even of love, and as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, of a ready mind, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. Hee saw what labours the Holy Apostles endured, what dangers they passed through, and how poore they were touching worldly wealth. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith of himselfe, wee are poore and yet make many rich; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 10. This is a worthy exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for us to follow.</p>
               <p>Indeed to many amongst us, if they have gifts of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for the ministry, and bee employed therein, and take paines, they thinke it so unworthy a thing to bee in pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as that they are ready to bee impationt at it; and thinke that the excellency of the worke of the ministry may war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant them to heape up Worldly treasure, even to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment of the Church; whereas certainely if the charge bee committed to us to feed the flock of CHRIST, and the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:125514:8"/> flock bee in that state, that wee cannot have the wealth of the World to abound in any plentifull measure, wee must bee content with that which may suffice even for necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Wee are not better then the Apostles were; wee are not better then the Angell of the Church of <hi>Smyrna.</hi> If wee should stand on getting wealth, and preferment here, it might bee said to us, you laboured indeed, but you had your wages.</p>
               <p>A fowle corruption also it is in some Ministers that suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer themselves to bee annoyed with popular feare, so as that they are most affraid of displeasing private persons, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in Parishes where their maintenance doth arise from the voluntary contribution of the people, who too much seeke to tie the tongues of their Preachers to their purse strings, (as it were,) which must open and shut according to their quarterly santasies. So that the people are bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in many places, onely to such, as preach as they would have them, such Preachers fare daintily, when others must take up with herbs.</p>
               <p>Thus then for conclusion of this matter touching <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Reasons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priations</hi> 3.</note> Church maintenance, wee wish that impropriations may bee all laid to the Church againe, and doe humbly sue and petition for it, considering:</p>
               <p>First, They were once lawfully laid to the Church, and never yet lawfully taken away againe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is no other certaine provision made for the ministry of the Gospell in this setled state but this.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The Gospell herein should not bee inferiour to the law.</p>
               <p>Yet wee doe not otherwise move this, but that as neere <note place="margin">Yet Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priatours not to bee loosers.</note> as may bee, such as are the present Impropriatours should not bee loosers, but if they hitherto have not made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Savers by the holding of them, our motion is, that they shall still continue holding them, or most part thereof till they bee; else suffer themselves to bee bought out by the well affected. Our trust is, ingenuous Gentlemen will
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:125514:8"/> be content in this case to be no Gainers by the Churches re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, and wee doe not move for them to become loosers.

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:125514:9"/> Painter. They move us to use language too light, for your Honours gravity.</p>
               <p>Indeed it is true, wee read that the Priests were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times simple, sometimes wicked men, as the Sonnes of <hi>Ely</hi> were the Sonnes of <hi>Beliall,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam</hi> 2. 12. and that none were to despise the ordinances of God for the unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of such Priests, for God promised that hee would blesse the people, <hi>Num.</hi> 26. 27. And in the Hebrew Canon they have this rule, <hi>Doe not marvell, and say, what availeth the blessing of this simple Priest? for the receiving the blessing depends not on the Priest, but on the holy blessed God,</hi> as it is written in the quoted place; <hi>They shall put my name upon the Sonnes of</hi> Israel, <hi>and I will blesse them.</hi> Yet please to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the end, not onely of <hi>Ely</hi> his Sonnes, but even of <hi>Ely</hi> himselfe too. And God forbid, the Fathers and Mothers of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> should suffer such things in their Sonnes that are got into the ministry, and not restraine them, contenting themselues with a sleighty rebuke, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Wee deny not, but there are many amongst us preach earnestly, but it is their owne Doctrine, and great punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments doe they threaten to the neglecters thereof: But that which God hath expressely and earnestly commanded, they preach very slackly. Yea they would discharge men from the punishment which God threatens to the Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours of them, like those in <hi>Jer.</hi> 14. 23. 27. <hi>chapters,</hi> and those in <hi>Ez.</hi> 13. These are the most pernicious, being often listened unto by many that are apt to receive pleasing things, and the Doctrines of men suteable to their owne humours.</p>
               <p>All these unable, unwilling, scandalous and dangerous Preachers, whence came they? how got they in? surely they are climbed in at the window. For the dumbe and unlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned God sent not; such as cannot, and such as will not preach God sent not: for whom hee sent, he sent to preach, and enabled them thereunto. But these steale and murther; they are Theeves and Robbers, Foxes and Wolves. They are Theeves (doth not CHRIST himselfe call them so?
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:125514:9"/> let not the termes bee offensive) for they take the tythes as Gods part, and doe not the office God hath appointed for such livings, that is, they feed not the flock with his word. If any take on him to bee a Physition, and is not, but takes <note place="margin">A Similie.</note> 10. l. to cure such an one, and either runneth away or doth no good, were not this apish Physition a Thiefe?

Thus doe the foresaid Ministers, are they not then Theeves and Robbers? They take away Gods goods, and their Neighbours against their will, and therefore they are Robbers; yea they are very Murtherers, Wolves, and false Prophets. A woman taking a child to nurse, and <note place="margin">A Similie.</note> either wanting milke herselfe, or an heart to give it any, suffers the child to perish, is shee not a Murtheresse? such are these, <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

A lazie person is unfit for the Clergy, none but labourers were sent into CHRISTS Vineyard. An Angell appeared to <hi>Zacharias</hi> exercising his Priesthood. Yet of any of the foresaid sorts the idle seemeth best, silence being better then bad speech.</p>
               <p>Then on the other side, these unworthies are not onely to bee displaced, but <hi>sufficient Incumbents are to bee set in their stead, &amp;c.</hi> as was said. There should bee such as would purely deliver the word of God, as was signified by the silver trumpets, <hi>Num.</hi> 10. 2. The materials being purest and fittest for sound, the Ministery of the word of God, and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:125514:10"/> the graces of his Spirit, were signified thereby, <hi>Esa.</hi> 58. 1. and 27. 13. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33. 3. <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. 1. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14 8.

Nay, except they did so, hee would banish them out of his Court. But when many amongst them for feare of loosing their honour and dignity, did rather forsake God, then that they should bee taken offending the Emperour, then did <hi>Constantius Chlorus</hi> discover his plot which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee had concealed, and falleth upon them with grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous chidings for forsaking of God, accounting them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of his service, commands them to depart out of his Court, with great vehemency uttereth these words, <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo fidem Imperatori praestabunt inviolatam, qui Deo sunt perfidi?</hi> How will they bee true to the Emperour, that are false to God?

               <p>Such a course as this (though excellent then) needs not now bee taken.

And the happy trienniall Parliament to decide such grander differences as cannot bee decided in particular Parishes, nor by the whole hundred.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>The power to bee committed to these consisteth in these particulars.</head>
               <p>TO oversee, that every Church and Chappell within <note place="margin">1. <hi>To see, every place have sufficient preaching as soone as may bee.</hi>
                  </note> their hundred bee (as neere as may bee) furnished with a sufficient Ministry, and that the same goe fairely on in an orderly way for edification.</p>
               <p>But for as much as wee feare each place cannot on the sudden bee furnished with sufficient preaching, therefore till that can bee effected, (for which wee pray) the said ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Ministers, or the major part of them should have power to chuse the places within their owne hundred for the said weekely exercises, and appoint Preachers out of themselves for the same.</p>
               <p>Yet as soone as God pleaseth to send forth any sufficient <note place="margin">Weekely exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim.</note> labourers into his Vineyard, the same shall joyfully bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to some particular Church or Chappell whch is in want. And though the Patron doe present or commend a Clarke to a Congregation, yet as neere as may bee there
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:125514:13"/> ought to bee an ingenuous and free consent of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, to which hee is to preach before hee bee instal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. Not bought and sould, <hi>Nec prece, nec pretio;</hi> much lesse should their consent bee forced or extorted.</p>
               <p>Our arguments for the Congregation to chuse their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister <note place="margin">People to chuse their Minister.</note> are:</p>
               <p>First, Because in the Apostles times, the Congregation did chuse their Minister, the Apostles themselves not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring any by their authority, but alwayes with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and approvement of the Church, <hi>Act,</hi> 6. 2. and 14. 23. 2.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Hereby the Church shall preserve her liberty which Christ gave her: for no Pastour nor Minister of God, was to bee thrust by Christs order on the Church against their will.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, By this meanes, the Minister may with a good conscience, exercise his talent towards the Lords flock that have chosen him, and bee encouraged thereto; and on the other side, the people may more easily submit themselves to him and his instructions.</p>
               <p>But now in case, the people doe not know who are fit <note place="margin">Assisters therein.</note> Ministers for them, and cannot judge thereof, then the foresaid approved Ministers should seeke out Preachers for them, or at least judge (when they are brought to them) of their fitnesse for the Ministry in generall, and for that Congregation in particular.</p>
               <p>This businesse, the Civill Magistrate hath committed to the Ministers of the Church. As did that godly Emperour <hi>Valentinianus,</hi> of whom <hi>Theodoretus</hi> maketh mention in his <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Valentinians</hi> example.</note> fourth Booke of Ecclesiasticall history, the fist and sixt Chapters. Though the Ministers put it to him freely to make his choyce, yet hee would not accept of that liberty and power, but left it to those, to whom it is due by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine institution, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 5. <hi>For this cause,</hi> Paul <hi>left</hi> Titus <hi>in Creete to set in order things that were wanting, and to ordaine Elders in every City, as hee had appointed him▪</hi> That is, to assist others in the election of their Ministers, and moderate the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:125514:14"/> businesse if need bee, as <hi>Calvin</hi> expounds it. And a strict observation hereof continued in the Primitive Church under Christian Kings and Emperours. In so much, that hee was not acknowledged for a lawfull Pastour of the Church, which was intruded on the Church by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of a great man, as most <hi>Orthodox</hi> Authours shew.</p>
               <p>Neither are any to buy this preferrement with money, <note place="margin">Not buy,</note> nor make any forceable entrance, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 18. 19. 20. 21. No, nor any other way to seeke this for the preferment sake, for that is not <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>If any desire the office of a Bishop, hee desireth a good worke.</hi> Hee nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commands, nor exhorts any to desire this office, but <note place="margin">Nov seeke preferment.</note> sheweth, it is an hard businesse: a worke, not a play: a care, not riotousnesse not free from censure: a Fatherly office, not a tyrannicall liberty.

               <p>Here might bee shewed what ones are to bee chosent what the manner of chusing them is: and how the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to bee performed, but then wee should bee tedious. And us the said approved Ministers (that have carried them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves as aforesaid, though they little thought to have seene these dayes,) together with their choyce assistants, are thus <note place="margin">Refuse the unworthy.</note> to chuse; so also, according to their Commission from the Honourable Parliament, to refuse and remove such as are crept in by craft, or broken in by force; for that they entred not into the sheepfold by the doore, but climbed in, some other way, and in are Theeves and Robbers, not to bee suffered no more in Church then in Common-wealth, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10. 1.</p>

               <p>The maine occasion wherefore wee move this, is the <note place="margin">Occasion.</note> many most notorious abuses of our present Spirituall Courts, (falsely so called;) Some whereof have bin grosse, even since the Parliament beganne to sit, as if on purpose they would improve their present oportunity while it lasted.</p>

And this power CHRIST hath given to the Church, though no power to bind the consciences of men with any now law necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belonging to faith and manners, neither have they any power to compell any but as is said.</p>
               <p>The office of a Minister consists as in the dispensation of <note place="margin">Ministers of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</note> the misteryes of God, as was said; so also in the administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Discipline, which is a certaine power given and granted of God to his Church, to direct, lead, and bring men to piety that are entred into CHRISTS flock, least they should either in Doctrine, or in conversation, commit any thing unbeseeming their Christian profession, to the scandall of it. Hereby offenders are reproved, rebuked, chidden and corrected, that they may returne into the right way, and every one performe his office according as God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed him.</p>
               <p>There is a marvelous great necessity of Discipline a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst <note place="margin">Necessity of Discipline.</note> us. It being no little dishonour to God, that the wicked, impenitent, blasphemous wretches, should runne
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:125514:15"/> on without just punishment, as if betweene them and the freeborne dutifull Sonnes of God, there were no difference, and that his Kingdome with the Kingdome of Sathan should bee so sowly mixed and confused. The Church by conniving at the wicked and impenitent, and not correcting them publikely and privately, not punishing them with the sword of the Spirit, doth make herselfe quilty before God of their damnation and destruction. By the liberty that hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto hath beene to goe on in wickednesse, the Kingdome of CHRIST is filled full of scandals, and the weake (whose number in the Church is great) being corrupted with the examples of the wicked, will bee seduced; much rather, therefore should such as are without the pale of CHRIST bee drawne into Gods sheepefold, that they which speake against us as evill doers, may see our good workes and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conversation amongst them, and glorifie God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 12. These should rather thus bee brought in, then that the sheepe of CHRIST which are already in his flock should bee offended and perverted by such fowle scandals raigning so rise, and yet suffered and winked at. <hi>A little leaven lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens the whole lump,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 9. <hi>Evill words cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt good manners,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 33.

               <p>This Discipline, or rather the administration of it, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <note place="margin">Power of the keyes.</note> the power of the keyes by CHRIST himselfe, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 19. and 18. 18. <hi>Joh.</hi> 20. 23.

               <p>As no City, nor House can stand and florish without the strength and stay of Discipline, of order, law and punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: So if Christs Kingdome here on earth, if his Church, doo want this speciall Government, it will runne into erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Doctrine and impious wickednesse, and so undoe it selfe, and yet never bee admonished, reproved, blamed, that it might bee regained; whereas, if such as shew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves stubburne, and will bee reclaimed and brought into the right path by no gentler way; bee feverely punished for their offences and grievous scandals, this will make much for the glory of God, and good of the Church. The cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of our nature is great, the infirmity of Saints not smale, this Discipline is a wholesome remedy, whereby the whole body of the Church, and every member thereof is so restrained and kept in, that we shall not be indulgent to our selves in that w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg> is evill, but kept close to our duty in our right paths by this bridle, when the bond of love and liberty will not doe it.

These things being so, God even from the beginning, would that great respect bee had to this ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in his Kingdome. And it much beloveth such to whom it is committed to bee most diligent observers and executioners of it. Also how wise, how circumspect, how moderate, all such should be, which execute this Discipline; the holy Apostle shewes, in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 1. 2. <hi>Rebuke not an Elder, but intreat him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

               </p>

               <p n="4">4. Such is the dignity and gravity of the Pastours office, that they may, and ought, bee content with it alone.

Yet <hi>Rebus sic stantibus;</hi> our humble motion is, that such of them as bee found faithfull, together with some other ancient learned Divines that have studied long, bee employed onely in the exercise of their Doctorshippe, or gift of teaching, as Divinity Lecturers. Of these, there should bee in every hundred one, and hee to bee seated in <note place="margin">Divinity Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nethly in each hundred, and how.</note> such a Parish, where is the largest maintenance, which may bee competent both for the Pastour that preacheth to that Congregation there, and also for the Teacher. This Teacher should bee employed onely in teaching the Pastours of that hundred at monethly exercises for that purpose; unto which the foresaid weekely exercise, should give place, and cease for that weeke monethly. This wee adde, least wee should leave out any order of Ministers appointed by CHRIST at the first, to remaine for ever. For such as these, were set out in the primitive times, whose office then was to teach the Pastours by interpreting to them the Scriptures, laying out the sense and Doctrine soundly, and confuting er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, &amp;c. The which is most necessary amongst us, Iesuites, and Popish Champions, in livery Habit as serving men, sometimes almost gravelling us with some studied dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, wherein they to our reproach find us shallow, through want of this helpe.</p>
               <p>This order of Ministers, were at the first called Doctours, or Teachers, as after is to bee seene. And a particular hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, seemeth somewhat neerely to resemble the primitive Congregations, called <hi>Ecclesiae.</hi> Of these Teachers, wee have indeed a commendable practise already in our Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity <note place="margin">Vniversity practise.</note> Professours, which read Divinity Lectures in the Schooles. The like whereto wee desire, may bee as is said in each hundred in the Countrey. Both which should bee <hi>Seminaria Pastorum;</hi> As <hi>Calvin</hi> speakes, Nurceries, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to young Divines after they have set upon the study of Divinity, and entred into the Ministry; the necessity of the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:125514:17"/> Countrey often calling them to leave the Vniversity, before they ever come to attend much to the Divinity Lectures, read by the Professours in Schooles there. See <hi>Wilson</hi> on <hi>Rom</hi> 12. <hi>Dial.</hi> 5. <hi>pag.</hi> 537.</p>
               <p>These being exempted both from teaching and ruling, only exercised monethly as is said in teaching, might also be fit to advise and give counsell to the younger sort, being now in their old age, and having now seene these dayes which they did not wot off; it adds something to their experience. Thus the <hi>Levits</hi> in their old age, even after they came to bee fifty yeares old, left off the harder service, but still had charge, <hi>Num.</hi> 4. 3. As Ministers at the first ordination, should not enter till they bee furnished with qualifications for so great a worke, so should they continue no longer charged with the full waight of the burthen of their function, then they are fit and able to undergoe it, but rather bee exempted therefrom unto more easie service, <hi>Num.</hi> 8. 25 26.</p>

               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:125514:18"/>
               <p> But now there is a wide difference betweene our Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Pastours of particular Congregations, for they have a different calling with us in <hi>England.</hi> The booke of ordination of Bishops, Priests, and Deacons shew, they have a different ordination, therefore must needs differ in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, according as the Apostle argueth, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7. 16. 17. 21. That the Priesthood of CHRIST was diverse from the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Priesthood, because the manner of ordaining each was diverse, the one being without an oath and for a time, the other being with an oath and for ever.</p>
               <p>The Bishops or Pastours of the Church, and the diverse orders of them, are frequently set downe in the word of God, yet no signe of any such Lord Bishops. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. throughout the whole Chapter, where all the orders are largely laid downe. Yea of the ordinary Ministers its plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirmed, that in respect of their office, they are all equall; neither ought they to exercise any absolute power in the Church, but onely that which is meerely ministeriall. See 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. and 4. also 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. and 3. and 4. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 11. and often else where.</p>
               <p>In the Apostles times, there was no signe of such, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the contrary; for as much as the grand controversies of Religion, and other Ecclesiasticall matters were deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by the Common vote of the Apostles together with the consent of the people, <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 6. and 11. 14. But espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the 15. <hi>Chapter</hi> wholy. Therefore much lesse, now the Apostles are dead, and the whole affaires fall to ordinary men.</p>
               <p>Such a Lordly authority is not onely unprofitable, but dangerous and hurtfull in as much, as it is so apt to degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate into tyranny, especially in such infirme men, through pride, ambition and other wickednesse, as evident expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience hath hitherto shewed amongst the Papists, and too much amongst our selves. By sundry histories and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <note place="margin">The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the <hi>Romane</hi> pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy.</note> writings it doth appeare that in the beginning of <hi>Constantine</hi> the great, there was much stirre about prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence, and in the <hi>Nicen</hi> Counsell, certaine Patriarkes

               <p>It fell out in processe, of time that the <hi>Roman</hi> Bishop increasing dayly in ambition and wealth, first under the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Phoca,</hi> about the yeare of CHRIST, 600. then under <note place="margin">

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Act.</hi> 6. Some widdowes were neglected in the dayly ministring; then the 12. Apostles called the multitude of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:125514:19"/> Disciples together, and told them, it was not fit they should leave the word of God and serve Tables, that is, to make provision for the maintenanne of the poore, for as much, as they were not able to satisfie both offices; therefore they looked out certaine men of honest report, which they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed over the businesse, that they might give themselves continually to prayer, and the ministration of the word. This pleased the whole multitude well, and they did so.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 1. There were in the Church at <hi>Antioch,</hi> certaine <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Teachers.</hi> How Prophets and Teachers differ, shall bee shewed after from other places. In this place, they are <hi>Synonima.</hi> Prophets here are not such, as had the rare gift of foretelling, but they were famous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters of the Scriptures of the Prophets. And they were exercised in teaching and exhorting, as <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth, in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. <hi>Calvins Com.</hi> on this place.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 23. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> appoint Ministers, but how? why, they ordained them Elders by election in every Church. The word <gap reason="foreign">

In this 14. <hi>Chap.</hi> though <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> bee said to ordaine the Elders, yet they doe it not onely of themselves, but by the election of all, for in creating Pastours the people had a free choyce, yet least any thing should bee done tumultuously, <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were over the rest as Moderatours, <hi>Cal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 6. 7. 8. Seeing then that we have gifts that are diverse, &amp;c. <hi>Paul</hi> teaches, that no brotherly helpe bee withheld from one another, for such assisting each other is the bond of mutuall communion. Herein consists the society of the godly, that one impart his gifts to another, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer himselfe to bee helped by the ability of others. Yet
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:125514:20"/> every one must keepe his owne order, wherein God hath set him, and not hinder others, for such as pervert Gods order withstand God himselfe who is the God of order. This hee sheweth by the comparison of a naturall body where every member keepeth its owne office, and not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades the roome and office of others.</p>
               <p>The gifts hee here sheweth are two in generall, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy <note place="margin">Two gifts.</note> and Ministry.</p>
               <p>First, <hi>Prophesie:</hi> Hereby hee meaneth the right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing <note place="margin">1 Prophesie what?</note> of the Scripture, and the faculty of explaining the Prophets and the Misteries of CHRIST in the Gospell. For in this sense <hi>Paul</hi> speakes, when hee saith in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 5. <hi>I would that yee all speake with tongues, but rather that yee Prophesie.</hi> And in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 9. <hi>Wee know in part and Prophesie in part.</hi> Hereby meaning, chiefely the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary teaching which was to continue. For this must bee <hi>according to the proportion of faith,</hi> that is, according to the first rules of Religion gathered, (as it is thought) by the Apostles out of the Scriptures, <hi>Cal.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>Vnto this Prophesying, here bee two offices belonging: <note place="margin">Whereto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth, 1. Teaching. 2. Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> First, Teaching, which is the office of the Doctour. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>xhortation, which is the office of Pastours. For these two offices wee confesse, are divided (though some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times their gifts may and doe meet in one, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 11.) and have their severall gifts. One hath the gift of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the other of wisedome, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 8. And severall operations or workes, for the one doth teach and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret the Scripture, lay out the sense and doctrine soundly, confuting errour, which is the Doctours part. The practise whereof, as was said, is commendable in our Vniversity. Professours which read Divinity Lectures in the Schooles; and wee wish the like were in our severall hundreds in manner aforesaid, and for the reasons aforesaid, this order being in the best and first Churches. If wee should wish every Parish had such, wee had no hopes to prevaile, though indeed, every Parish hath need of more Ministers then one. Then to exhort the Hearers unto godlinesse in practicall
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:125514:20"/> points, and to comfort and strengthen the infirmity of faith in the Saints, as also to administer Sacraments, this is the part of the Pastours or Exhorters. <hi>Origen,</hi> and <hi>Peter Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi> take Prophesying thus generally for Doctrine and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, so doth <hi>Paraeus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. <hi>Ministry:</hi> This is the other generall head, and it is not <note place="margin">2 Ministry what?</note> here to bee taken in a particular sense, but in a generall mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as comprehending other kinds under it, which were wont to bee conversant about the body and temporall things. This pertaineth to Discipline and manners. It hath <note place="margin">Its offices.</note> three gifts, or is here subdivided into three offices.</p>
               <p>First, To <hi>distribute</hi> the treasury or Church goods to the <note place="margin">1. To distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute.</note> poore, as every one had need, <hi>Act.</hi> 6 3. 5. Their gift was <hi>simplicity,</hi> that is, that they without fraud, vaine-glory, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse, or frowardnesse, should give out the almes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Those that were joyned to the Pastours, as <note place="margin">2. To Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne.</note> assistants and helpers for Government of the flock to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent scandals and offences, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 28. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. Thus <hi>Martyr, Clevian</hi> and <hi>Paraus</hi> doe judge, <hi>Piscator</hi> also. These Master <hi>Calvin</hi> calleth Seniours, <hi>Osiander</hi> Censours of manners, <hi>Tertullian</hi> Presidents, which attended and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served outward behaviours onely. Their gift was dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, which stood in a firme purpose and strong endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to doe the businesse and charge committed to them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The last sort of Ministers, here mentioned are <note place="margin">3. Mercy-shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers who?</note> mercy-shewers in these words, <hi>Hee that sheweth mercy with cheerefulnesse.</hi> Thus <hi>Fajus,</hi> and <hi>Gualter,</hi> and <hi>Paraeus</hi> expound it. These mercy-shewers were not such, as were spoken off, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 35. 36 For that worke is common to all Christians, but here hee meaneth such mercifull workes as bee mentioned, in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 10. They which were to bee employed in this service of shewing mercy, were such as were appointed to looke to the poore, sick, aged, impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, strangers, exiles, orphans, &amp;c. Their gift was cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, which containeth; First, Alacrity of heart. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Gentlenesse in words. Thirdly, Pleasantnesse in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:125514:21"/> For as their worke was such as might breed loathsomnesse to attend sick and feeble persons, so they were to bee old widdowes and aged men, who naturally are soure and testy; therefore needed this precept of cheere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse. Thus wee see, one had one function, another had another; one was a Doctour, another a Pastour; one an El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, another a Deacon; one a Superiour and ruled, others obey as Inferiours, and every one of these, had their severall gifts for the performance of their worke. As man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists of <hi>Soule</hi> (which hath <hi>understanding and will)</hi> and a <hi>Body;</hi> God willing to have the whole man saved, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for the <hi>understanding</hi> part, <hi>Doctrine</hi> to teach it, and for the <hi>will, Exhortations</hi> to quicken it: And for the <hi>Body,</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine other <hi>Officers</hi> to looke to the welfare and carriage of it before men.</p>
               <p n="5">5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. Where the Apostle reckons up the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of gifts given for the edification of the Church, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth them in this manner, yet not all, but those which ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to his present purpose, as <hi>viz.</hi> First, To one is given the word of wisedome. Secondly, To another, the word of knowledge, <hi>Verse</hi> 8. Knowledge and wisedome are taken diversely in Scripture, but in this place, <hi>Calvin</hi> taketh them as <hi>Minus</hi> and <hi>Majus,</hi> as in <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 3. where also they are joyned together as here. For <hi>Paul</hi> shewes, that all the treasures of wisedome and knowledge, are hid in CHRIST. By knowledge therefore, hee meaneth the understanding of holy things; by wisedome, hee meaneth the perfecting of them; and skill to apply, that which is understood, to use. Thirdly, To another Faith, <hi>Verse</hi> 9. And by Faith, hee here meaneth a particular Faith, as appeareth by the context, which worketh miracles, such as <hi>Judas</hi> had, and by it wrought miracles. Fourthly, The gift of healing, the which what it is, no man is ignorant. Fifthly. To another, the working of miracles, <hi>Verse</hi> 10. as to worke by miracles against Sathan and Hypocrites, as was done against <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias, Elimas, &amp;c.</hi> These were great workes to restraine the Devils, to drive them out. Sixthly, To another Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:125514:21"/> phecy, <hi>Verse</hi> 10. that is, To declare Gods mysteries, and that in a singular manner, as Gods Messengers or Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to men. Seventhly, To another discerning of Spirits, that is, to try both the Doctrines and Persons. Hereby, they discerned the true Ministers of CHRIST from the false. Eightly, To another, diverse kinds of tongues, to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the interpretation of tongues. Interpretation diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from the knowledge of the tongues, for they that were endued with the knowledge of tongues, did not onely keepe themselves to that language where they were: Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretours translated the strange language into another tongue. These gifts they then got not by labour nor study, but had them by a wonderfull Revelation of the Spirit, and so they were extraordinary and temporary onely for that time, and so now are ceased, and not to bee insisted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>Having thus in the beginning of the Chapter spoken of <note place="margin">Offices.</note> their gifts, hee towards the end speakes of their offices wherein they were employed, after that they were sitted with such gifts. He doth not here reckon up all the offices, but some for instance. In <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. is a fuller enumeration of them, as wee shall see by and by, to which wee will ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten, because those are required to the perpetuall Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church. Those that hee mentioneth here are <note place="margin">Some were perpetuall, as Teachers which were limited.</note> some perpetuall, some temporary. The perpetuall are those, which are necessary for the Government of the Church. The temporary are those, which were necessary for the laying the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>undation of the Church at first. Of the former sort, was the office of Teachers. Of the other, was the office <note place="margin">Others tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles.</note> of Apostles. For God created Apostles to preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell through the World, and did not limit them to any certaine places and Parishes. But they were to Preach the Gospell to all Nations, the which they did by Preaching in the chiefest Cities and places of each Countrey, not having time for particulars, and from those chiefe Cities, the newes of the new Doctrine, spread into all the severall parts of the Countrey. Whereas Pastours were tied to particular
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:125514:22"/> congregations, and not commanded to preach to all the World, but to have a care of that Church, which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their trust.</p>
               <p>Secondly, From Apostles hee cometh to Prophets in <note place="margin">Prophers.</note> this 28. <hi>Verse,</hi> though in the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> hee joynes Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists to Apostles. By Prophets here hee meaneth not such as had the gift of foretelling matters, but such as had a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular gift of interpreting (as before) and also of wisedome to apply the Scripture to present use. That this is so doth appeare, because hee here preferreth Prophecy before all other gifts, for that it makes more for edification, which commendation agreeth not to the prediction of future things; also when hee hath laid downe the Prophets office, hee adds this, <hi>that hee speakes to men to edification, to exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and to comfort in Chap.</hi> 14. 3. The which are all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct from predictions. Prophets therefore in this place, may bee chiefe Interpretours of the Scripture; such also as are endewed with a more then ordinary wisedome and dexterity to see into the present necessity of the Church, that they may speake properly to it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Teachers betweene them and Prophets, this <note place="margin">Teachers.</note> difference may bee noted, that the office of a Teacher stands in this, that hee maintaine and uphold sound Doctrine, that purity of Religion may continue in the Church. And Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, hee makes those, which reveale the will of God, and apply the prophecies, threatnings, promises, and the whole Scripture fitly for the present use of the Church, as is often occasioned to bee said. <hi>Cal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for those that hee speakes of that doe miracles, and <note place="margin">Miracles hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</note> have the gift of healing, hee spake of them before; in <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. yet there hee speakes not so much of the gifts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as the administration thereof. And as for the hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers here mentioned, they were <hi>Deacons, which had care for</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Helpers.</note>
                  <hi>the poore.</hi> And the Governours they <hi>were Elders,</hi> which were the Overseers of Discipline.</p>
               <p>For the Primitive Church had a Senate, which was to <note place="margin">Governours.</note> keepe the Common-people in honesty of manners, which
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:125514:22"/>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth, else where when hee maketh a twofold order of Presbyters, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. And the Government consisted of Elders, which were men more excellent, then others for gravity, experience, and authority. <hi>Calv.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lastly, Vnder diversity of tongues hee comprehends, both the knowledge of tongues and the gift of interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. These were distinct gifts, for sometimes, one spake with many tongues, and yet did not understand the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of that Church where hee was; this defect Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours supplied.</p>
               <p>Now seeing, all were not Apostles, nor all Prophets, they were not all Teachers, &amp;c. Therefore, they should be helpers one to another, and not jarre, not proudly insult, but covet every one after edification to profit the Church with the gifts God hath given him.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. 11. Here the Apostle reckons up foure severall sorts of offices:</p>
               <p>First, CHRIST gave some to bee Apostles, which is to bee taken in a proper signification for CHRISTS twelve chosen Apostles, in whose order, <hi>Paul</hi> afterwards was. Their office was to publish the Gospell through the World as was said, to plant Churches, to erect the Kingdome of CHRIST, all abroad, and so had not proper congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The next to these Apostles were Evangelists, and their office was like the other Apostles, onely they differed in respect of dignity. Of this sort were <hi>Timothy</hi> and such like. For though <hi>Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l</hi> joyne him to himselfe in his salutations, yet hee doth not make him his companion in the Apostleship, but claimeth this as peculiar to himselfe. Next unto the Apostles, yet the Lord made use of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of these.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Betweene these two, <hi>Paul</hi> interposeth Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, which are as those in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. Famous Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours of the Scripture, which also made application for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent use.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Pastours and Teachers; By Teachers or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:125514:23"/> hee here meaneth Interpretours of Scripture, to keepe up soundnesse of Doctrine, and he may bee a Teacher, which is not appointed for Preaching. Pastours are such, as had the charge of certaine congregations. Not, but that sometimes one man may bee both, but the gifts are diverse. Onely these two latter, are perpetuall, without whom there can bee no Government of the Church, <hi>Calv. Com. ibid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. In the first verse, the Apostle sheweth, what a speciall care must bee had in chusing Ministers to so excellent a worke, as to personate the Sonne of God, to build up the Kingdome of CHRIST, to take care for mans salvation, which CHRIST hath bought with his pretious bloud, and to governe the Church which is GODS owne inheritance. And though they are here called Bishops, yet the name is but the same with Ministers, or Pastours, or Presbyters. These must bee such as are apt to teach, <hi>Verse</hi> 2. not onely to have learning in them, but also the gift of teaching. They must have volubility of tongue, and it must bee such as is fit for edification, and they must have skill to apply matters for the use of the people. Againe, hee must take care for the Church of GOD, <hi>Verse</hi> 5. for the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it, and carry himselfe, as that hee may not bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible in the family, much lesse in the Church. These must bee such for their conversation, as that they which are without, even the very Infidels may bee forced to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them honest men. Then in <hi>Verse</hi> 8. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Hee speaketh of other Church Ministers, which are the Deacons, which exercise a publike office in the Church, though not to teach, and sheweth what ones they must bee. These were such Deacons as <hi>Luke</hi> mentioneth, in <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 3. which had the care of the poore, and what their office was, <hi>Calvin</hi> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth fully in his Institutions.</p>
               <p n="8">8. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 17. to 23. <hi>Let the Elders that rule well, bee counted worthy of double honour, especially, they which labour in the word and doctrine.</hi> This place is most cleere, that there <note place="margin">Elders of two sorts.</note> were two sorts of Elders, <hi>scil.</hi> Teaching, (or rather Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting)
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:125514:23"/> and Lay-elders. This is the ground of our foresaid course in the greatest part of it. For here, hee sheweth the Church Governours to bee some ruling, and some both ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing and labouring in the word and doctrine; the latter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing assisted by the former, and the former directed by the latter. Both were much to bee honoured with double ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, which is maintenance and reverence according to <hi>Chrysostome: Paul</hi> preferreth those, that labour in the word and Doctrine above the other. And those two words, <hi>word and doctrine,</hi> signifie one thing, to wit, the preaching of the word. But they were not so to be accounted off, except they ruled well; wherefore wee hope the refusing of them that hitherto have demeaned themselves unworthily, or not laboured in the word and doctrine, is but according hereto by the rule of contraries. They are not to bee better accounted off, nor provided for, then is aforesaid in their allowance.</p>
               <p>Though, <hi>Paul</hi> calleth the Church Governours Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters or Elders, yet it is not so much, because of their age, as in regard had to their office. Those that onely ruled, and had not the office of teaching, were cerraine grave, honest, approved men, chosen out of the people, which were to execute Discipline with the Pastours by a common consent and authority, and they were as Censours for correction of manners, as <hi>Calvin</hi> commenteth. <hi>Ambrose</hi> also complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that this custome did begin to grow out of use through <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Note. </seg>
                  </label> the slothfulnesse of the Teachers, or rather through their pride, who would bee alone in ruling without the Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elders assistance.</p>
               <p>Then the Apostle sheweth the maintenance of these, <note place="margin">Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</note> especially of the Teaching Elders. For it is an ungratefull World that maintaineth not the bodies of such as feed their Soules with <hi>Manna</hi> from Heaven. Sathan labours to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive the Church of the word and doctrine by affrighting men from undertaking the waight of this office for feare of poverty and want. But <hi>the Oxe must not bee mouselled that treadeth out the corne;</hi> For <hi>the Labourer is worthy of his</hi>

               <p>But against these, <hi>Paul</hi> armeth <hi>Titus,</hi> shewing what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Ministers hee ought to chuse; cheifely requiring, that they bee <hi>men of sound Doctrine;</hi> that they may resist the Adversary. Also they must bee <hi>unreproveable,</hi> that is, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all infamy, whereby their authority might bee dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.

               <p>Thus having given some insight into such Scriptures, as treat of this subject, they all seeme, and truly doe tend this way that wee point at. Whosoever possesseth himselfe <label type="milestone">

                  </label> well with the course in the reading of it, and then considers of the same in reading these Scriptures, may see they close in together one with another. In perusing these Scriptures, consider what was extraordinary and temporary, and so ended with those extraordinary times, the which are easie to discerne: and those that were ordinary and perpetually to remaine, being thought of a part by themselves; the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:125514:24"/> course may easily appeare to bee consonant to them. How this will seeme to every Reader (into whose hands it may fall) wee know not; any thing may be carped at, the mind of the Reader is all. But whosoever hee is, wee beg of him to looke to CHRIST his owne institution of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall <note place="margin">Ever looke to Christs Institution.</note> Government. Hee being Master of the house, would not leave it without order. Some Doctrines are hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Doctrines as <hi>Paul</hi> calleth them, because they suite to mans disposition. So there are humane orders and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments devised by men, which may seeme lesse liable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; farre more plausible, but our eye must bee on the primitive Institution. Some plead for the Episcopacy still, some for the paring of the abuses, and let the substance stand; would wee but looke well to the Institution, and study the point throughly, wee should all looke one way. Papists may tell us of many faigned Sacraments, and shew much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance, betweene what they call the thing signifying, and the thing signified, and a fairer face, happily they may put on the faigned ones then on the true, but it is the very point of Institution that discriminateth all. So it is in Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall Government. All must bee brought to this Touch-stone, and that let us account for adulterate, and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torogeny, that is not consentaneous to primary Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Besides those extraordinary Embassadours of God, the Apostles, Prophets, and Evangelists, which were but tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary, <note place="margin">3. From Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</note> there are but these three other orders (already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned) in the Church of the new Testament, which are to continue for ever, <hi>viz.</hi> First, Bishops or Pastours, and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of Gods word. Secondly, Presbyters or Elders par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly so called. Thirdly, Deacons, or the Church Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surers and Bestowers of almes, and such gifts as were given to the Church.</p>
               <p>For as there are three chiefe objects of Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment <note place="margin">First, From the objects.</note> which ever continue, <hi>scilic.</hi> First, The word and Sacraments. Secondly, The administration of Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, for the Reformation of life and manners. Thirdly,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:125514:25"/> The care of the poore, sickly and afflicted ones. So likewise ought there to bee three ordinary degrees of men to bee oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied about the Government of the Church thus. Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which you have seene, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. and 13. and 14. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. and 5. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. wholy. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4. <hi>&amp;c.

So God hath set out Teachers for the mind, Pastours for the will, and one to doe both; where both Teachers and Pastours can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not distinctly bee had. And Lay-elders and Deacons for the body. All which is in the proposed course.</p>
               <p>It was also pointed at before, that one Government was <note place="margin">3 From the State of the Church.</note> for the foundation of the Church at first, another for the continuance of the Church; wee must not thinke of the Apostles having Successours, these wee enlarge not, they are plaine of themselves.</p>
               <p>From the Testimonies of most Orthodox Authours that <note place="margin">4. From Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours the best.</note> have written fully of this subject, and doe accord generally with this course in one consent.</p>

                  <hi>etiam jus Canonicum docet, Dist.</hi> 93. <hi>cap. legimus.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Presbyters and Bishops by Gods law are equall, that is, they administer the same office, in the same manner, and with the same authority: So that (saith hee,) the Church of God which in respect of its head, <hi>scil.</hi> The Lord IESUS CHRIST, is a Monarchy, ought to bee governed <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratically</hi> by Bishops and Pastours, which are equall in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, though they may differ in distinct functions, and degrees, for order and government of the Church; whence it was, that the Presbyters had the power of imposition of hands in ordaining Pastours, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 14. <hi>Can.

               <p>Indeed, after the Apostles times to prevent Schismes, one of the Presbyters was some what preferred above the rest, which afterward was. <gap reason="foreign">

Quorum vices,</hi> speaketh in this manner, <hi>Pro Apostolis filii nati sunt tibi: Constituti sunt Episcopi.</hi> Yet this distinction must diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bee noted in this place, how the Apostles had Successours, how not. <hi>Peter, Andrew, Iohn,</hi> and the rest of them in the Apostleship are considered, either as Pastours, or as Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles. As Pastours, they have Successours; as Apostles, they have none. And so the quoted Authours are to bee under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood. Every Bishop then, (that is, every Minister,) is a Successour of <hi>Peter,</hi> who preach the same Doctrine which <hi>Peter</hi> did. <hi>Non habent enim Petre haereditatem, qui Petri fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem non habent, quam impia divisione discerpunt,</hi> saith <hi>Ambros. de paenit. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. which is cited in the <hi>Canon Law de paenit dist.</hi> 1. <hi>cap. potest.</hi> Whosoever therefore doth not teach and follow the same Doctrine which <hi>Peter</hi> preached, is no Successour of <hi>Peter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All Bishops are equall therefore amongst themselves, in respect of their office of feeding, that is, of teaching and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministring the Sacraments, and of binding and loosing. This the same Canon Law teacheth, <hi>Dist.</hi> 93. <hi>cap. legimus.</hi> Yet for the preservation of order and Ecclesiasticall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, when divisions did arise, the Church at length, long after the Apostles, somewhat preferred one before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to keepe them within limits, <hi>Et coercere,</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And as the same Authour saith, It is true indeed, all Pastours are Bishops, and were commonly so called; <hi>Act.</hi> 20. 28. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 1. Yet in succession of time, hee that was before his other fellow Collegues for order sake, was called a Bishop, the rest Presbyters.

               <p>But is this the onely regiment of the Church, thus to bee <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obj. </seg>10</label> ruled by an Ecclesiasticall Government alone, is this your drift?</p>

                  </label> our purpose was to shew the Civill Government of the Church, also as well, as wee have the Ecclesiasticall. And this wee crave leave now to doe that wee may not bee mistaken.</p>
               <p>The Civill Government of the Church is, the corporall <note place="margin">Civill Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church.</note> Government thereof under the Civill Magistrate, to whom God will have his Church in subjection in this World, for the preservation of outward peace and quietnesse. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 1. <hi>Let every soule bee subject to the higher powers, &amp;c. Tit.</hi> 3. 1. <hi>Put them in mind to bee subject to Principalities and powers, to obey Magistrates.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13. <hi>Submit your selves to every ordinance of man for the Lords sake, whether it bee to the King as Supreme, or unto Governours sent by him, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:125514:31"/> From this subjection no man is exempted, though hee bee an Apostle, though hee bee an Evangelist, though hee bee a Prophet.</p>
               <p>1. All Churchmen ought to bee subject to the secular <note place="margin">All in subje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and why?</note> Magistrate, in respect of the outward and Civill rule, and that for these reasons.</p>
               <p>First, God hath required it of them. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13. 14. <hi>Submit your selves to every ordinance of man for the Lords sake, &amp;c. Rom.</hi> 13. 1. Wherefore the Civill power of the Magistrate over the Church is of Divine right, not humane, nor customary.</p>
               <p>Secondly, In the time of the old Testament, the Priests were in subjection to the Kings.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, CHRIST himself &amp; his Apostles, and their god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followers were subject in temporall things to the secular Magistrate▪ CHRIST paid tribute to <hi>Caesar,</hi> was judged before <hi>Pilate.</hi> So was <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle before <hi>Festus, Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix,</hi> and <hi>Nero</hi> the Emperour. And <hi>Paul</hi> doth not appeale from <hi>Festus</hi> the chiefe Ruler to <hi>Peter</hi> the chiefe of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, but to the Emperour <hi>Nero. Augustine</hi> confesseth himselfe subject in his <hi>Exposition on the Roman<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s, Num.</hi> 72. So doth <hi>Policarpus of Smyrna, Euseb. Histor. Eccl. l.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>2. They ought to bee subject in all things, which Kings <note place="margin">And how▪</note> shall appoint in Ecclesiasticall order according to the will of God, as outward decency and matters indifferent. Thus the Priests and Levits were subject to the order which <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> appointed, and which <hi>Solomon</hi> after established, and <hi>Hezechia</hi> and <hi>Iosiah</hi> brought into use againe afterwards.</p>
               <p>Such authority, God hath given to godly Kings Princes, and Magistrates in the Church, therefore they have the chiefe authority in their Dominions, both in respect of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall Government, and also in regard of their care for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the worship of God, as the example of <hi>Moses, Iosua,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> teach. Wherefore the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> with his Cardinals, false Priests, and Clergy, doe resist the will of God, while they deny subjection to be due to the Civill Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate.</p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:125514:32"/>
               <p> It is necessary, the Church should have a Magistrate over her. <note place="margin">Magistrate necessary for the Church.</note>
               </p>
               <p>For first, Hee is ordained of God to defend the Church. <hi>Iudg.</hi> 2. 16. The Lord raised them up Iudges to deliver them out of the hands of them that spoil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Without the Magistrate, true Religion cannot long subsist. <hi>Iudg</hi> 17. 6. and 19. 1. <hi>In those dayes there was no King in Israel, but every man did that which was right in his owne eyes.</hi> A good Magistrate, that is faithfull and wise, is a good token of Gods love towards a people, as the Queene of <hi>Sheba</hi> saith, 1 <hi>King</hi> 10. 9.</p>
               <p>The Church is in the Common-wealth, as <hi>Optatus Mile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitanus</hi> saith. Yet this must rightly bee understood. For <note place="margin">Church is in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.</note> the Church and the Common-wealth, sometimes differ both really and respectively, sometimes onely respectively. After the ascention of CHRIST into Heaven the Church differed from the Common-wealth, both really and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectively, and the manner of it was wholly separated from the manner of the Common-wealth, before the saving Doctrine of the Gospell had broken the obstinate minds and wickednesse of Infidels. But after that the darkenesse of the errour of the Gentiles was driven away, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession <note place="margin">Reall di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note> of Christianity was received by most men, the Church was after a sort the same with the Common-wealth. For at that time, the people which made the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, the same also were the Church, though in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent manner and end. Especially, then the Church &amp; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth were all one, when the beleeving Emperours <note place="margin">Both one.</note> published liberty for Christian Religion, and made that a Christian Common-wealth, which before was Heathen, wherefore the beleeving Emperour, is the temporall head of the Christian people, and the Rector and temporall head of the faithfull.</p>
               <p>Though the same people bee the Church and Common-wealth, <note place="margin">Yet differ.</note> yet there is a difference betweene Church and Common-wealth: for the end of the institution of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth is for the obtaining of an humane good; but the end of gathering the Church, is for the worship of <note place="margin">In end▪</note>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:125514:32"/> God, and for a preparation of future happinesse. Neither are the Church and Common-wealth distinguished onely by a different end, but also by their condition, institutions, and <note place="margin">Condition.</note> government. The Common-wealth is conversant here in this World, as in it's owne lawfull Countrey, and gets worldly wealth and the meanes of this life, obtaineth power and enlargeth it's coasts as much as it can; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is an outward good in it; therefore the men of the Common-wealth commonly esteeme it highly. But now the Church striveth for the price of the high calling of God in CHRIST, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3. 14. and bendeth her hopes and thoughts without ceasing to the fruition of a better life: the Church doth not possesse the outward goods of the World, but onely maketh use of them. Neither doth shee esteeme the World as her owne Countrey, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 29. 30. 31. Therefore the Church is called by another name, <hi>scil.</hi> the City of God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 87. 3. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. 2. and shee hath her conversation in Heaven, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 20. shee saith with CHRIST, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8. 30. <hi>My Kingdome is not of this World.</hi> This difference then betweene Church and Common-wealth, requireth diverse Governours: they that governe the Church are by a common name called Ministers, they that governe the Common-wealth, are called Magistrates.</p>
               <p>Both the Magistrates and the Ministers, receive their power from CHRIST, who was both King and Priest. The Magistrate receiveth the Civill power, the Ministers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Ecclesiasticall power, CHRIST being God and Man, is the Authour of both powers. Ministers in Divine things depend not on the Magistrates, nor the Magistrates in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane things on Ministers.</p>
               <p>Both Ministers and Magistrates have the same beginning, <note place="margin">All power from Christ.</note>
                  <hi>viz.</hi> from CHRIST, who saith to all Ministers in <hi>Peter, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eede my sheepe, Ioh</hi> 21. 16. <hi>and to all people</hi> hee saith, <hi>Give to Caesar that which is Caesars, Matt.</hi> 22. 21.</p>
               <p>By this that hath beene said, it appeareth, that the Civill <note place="margin">They crosse not, yet dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer.</note> and Ecclesiasticall Government resist not one another, but the one is fit for and suteable to the other. Neither yet are
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:125514:33"/> they confused as <hi>Romane Bishops</hi> say, who would usurpe both Ecclesiasticall and Civill government to themselves; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in the new Testament, no man ought to bee both a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster and a secular Magistrate.</p>
               <p>Yet the Civill and Ecclesiasticall Government differ some wayes, as namely:</p>
               <p>First, The Civill Government hath authority and power <note place="margin">Power.</note> to compell men: the Church Government is but a service or simple ministry. CHRIST being head reserveth autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in himselfe; <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 25. 26. <hi>Yee shall not exercise Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, but hee that is chiefe, shall bee as him that serveth.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 5. 21. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 24. and 4. 5. <hi>We preach not our selves, but</hi> CHRIST IESUS, <hi>and our selves your servants for</hi> CHRISTS <hi>sake.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>The Elders must not bee Lords over Gods heritage, but examples to the flock.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The proper subject of the Civill Government, <note place="margin">Subject.</note> is the matters of this World, as the life, body, state, credit of the subject, &amp;c. whereas the proper subject of the Church Government are matters holy and divine, as those which God hath necessarily required to the sanctification of our soules and consciences; and also such as the honesty and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Church require to bee ordained and observed. A King is not properly the Rectour of the Church, but of the Common-wealth, yet hee is the Defender of the Church. The Civill power hath not onely direct authority in temporall matters, but also indirect authority for the right ordering Ecclesiasticall matters, especially over Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters that doe not rightly performe their duty to the Church; 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24. 6. 8. 11. 12. <hi>Ioash</hi> gave order for the repaire of the Temple, and gave order especially to the Priests and Levits about it, that too much neglected it. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 12. 4. <hi>Iehoash</hi> likewise gave order to the Priests for the repaire of the Temple, and after required an account, and reason why it was not done. But the Ministers of the word of God are so exercised about Divine matters, that they are prohibited to meddle with secular businesse. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they may touch upon such things out of a charitable
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:125514:33"/> office, but not out of any Sacerdotall power.</p>
               <p>Against this, is objected the example of the Priests of <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Obj. </seg>
                  </label> the old Testament, and of the Prophets, who not onely touched upon the Common-weale matters, but mannaged the greatest imployments thereof?</p>
               <p>But this, they did either by expresse command from God, as <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sol. </seg>
                  </label> when <hi>Elisha</hi> annointed King <hi>Iehu,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 9. or by some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary leave, the publike safety of the State requiring it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The proper end of the Civill Government, is <note place="margin">End:</note> the preservation of Civill society amongst men: whereas the proper end of Church Government, is the preservation of the communion of Saints, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 42. and 4 32.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, God would have his Church in this World <note place="margin">Place.</note> subject to the Civill Magistrate, that it might looke for its owne Kingdome in the Heavens, where at length it shall raigne, but not to rule here, till it come to its head there.</p>
               <p>The Common-wealth hath a Kingdome, which begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and endeth here in this World. Thus CHRIST would have his Church Ministry a service, not rule; thus for the difference. The good God of power so rule us all here, that wee may rule with him hereafter.</p>
               <p>For conclusion, though wee conceive, this is the truth <note place="margin">Conclusion.</note> according to CHRIST IESUS for the maine and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of it, containing all the orders and particulars in it, which CHRIST instituted as essentiall and perpetuall, yet wee shall rejoyce to see it rectified in any particular circumstance by the quicker sighted. And hope this our offering towards the Lord his building, will bee accepted: Goats haire was welcome of old. <hi>Exod.</hi> 25. 4. and 35. 6.</p>
               <p>This is indeed a point, that should bee studied by such, as would and should bring in CHRISTS Government a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, for that which any study themselves, taketh most impression in their mind. Yet herein, such should bee sure to read the soundest Orthodox Authours, for that many there are fowly corrupted, though they beare a faire shew.</p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:125514:34"/>
               <p> Many pamphlets are thrust out, some to little purpose; some too too presumptuous, and wee feare offensive to your Honours. Wee hope this worke will no more offend, then CHRISTS owne institution of old. Wee Ministers conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate the bread and wine, but by declaring the first institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it: And how shall we declare by writing or preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the holinesse of our Church Government, but by shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lords own institution of it? Let us not listen to those that weave the web of their owne inventions, but cleave to CHRIST and his Gospell, having our eye mainely on CHRISTS owne institution, as in the Word and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, so also in Discipline.</p>
               <p>Mightily did the word of God prevaile in the primitive <note place="margin">Why the word workes not now.</note> times: And some blessing, the Lord pleased to bestow on his ordinances amongst us till of late; but now since cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Government waxed more ridged, changing the Lords ordinances and constitutions for humane inventions, the Lord hath almost wholly left his house and forsaken his heritage, because of this plague raigning and ruling in it, so that few, few now a dayes are wrought upon by the word. Which of us would or could have any joy to stay in his owne house, if we might not rule and beare sway there; but strumpets must order all, and that quite crosse to our owne minds, entertaining strange Lovers as <hi>Israell</hi> did. Which moved the Lord to leave them to themselves, and so to bee a prey to their Neighbour Nations. The maine occasion was, because they set up Kings and not by him; they erected an other Government then ever hee appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Alas! they which goe after humane divises, come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in their owne name, not in the name of CHRIST: <hi>Calv.</hi> on <hi>Matt.</hi> 18. 20. Wherefore now our last Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition is, that the Church may bee so ordered, that CHRIST may come into his house againe. Let Buyers and Sellers bee whiped out, if lesser adoe will not serve. Let not Bryers and Brambles any longer beare rule, but the tale Cedar and fertile Olive. So shall all the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:125514:34"/> that have lately hid themselves, creepe forth as Bees out of the Hive in this faire Sunny-day, and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly labour for that, which is sweeter then the hony and the hony combe; heartily praying as to bee delivered from Tyranny so to bee kept from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion.</p>
